**README**

This repository contains two different root scripts:

1) dk2nuTree converts from the DUNE flux trees to a lighter tree structure with the essential variables for the timing analysis: parent information, time and location where the neutrino was produced, energy, etc

2) nuTree2GlobesFlux convolves the relative arrival time of the neutrinos with the beam time structure and a detector resolution and makes histograms/globes flux files binned by arrival-time bins.

More details can be found in the READMEs for each folder
